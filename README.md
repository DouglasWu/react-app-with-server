# react-app-with-server

This template project uses [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) as the server side and  [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as the client side.

The code is based on [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) written by [fullstackreact](https://www.fullstackreact.com/).

If you don't have create-react-app, install it first:
```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DouglasWu/react-app-with-server.git
cd react-app-with-server/
npm i

cd client
npm i

cd ..
npm start
```
